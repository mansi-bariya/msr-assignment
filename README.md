Overview of the project
1. Styling
- I've used the module css for styling (reason - Each component's styles are contained within its own module, reducing the risk of naming clashes.)

2. Folder Structure
- I've created the layouts folder for future purpose if there are multiple pages then layout will be helpful
- components folder has commonly used components
- containers folder has pages contain
- In HomeComponents folder I've implemented components which will be used only in Home page
- routes folder has routing
